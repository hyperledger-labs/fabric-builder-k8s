# How to contribute

There are lots of ways to contribute, and we :heart: them all!

## Questions

If you have any suggestions, questions about the project, or are interested in contributing, you can find us in the [fabric-kubernetes](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/945796983795384331) channel on Discord.

## Issues

All issues are tracked in [our issues tab in GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-builder-k8s/issues). If you find a bug which we don't already know about, you can help us by creating a new issue describing the problem. Please include as much detail as possible to help us track down the cause.

## Fixes

If you want to begin contributing code, looking through our open issues is a good way to start. Try looking for recent issues with detailed descriptions first.

## Enhancements

Open an issue to make sure your contibution is likely to be accepted before investing a lot of effort in larger changes.

## Pull Requests

We use [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) to deliver changes to the code. Follow these steps to deliver your first pull request:

1. [Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) and create a new branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've added any new features or made breaking changes, update the documentation.
4. Ensure all the tests pass.
5. Include a descriptive message, and the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works) on all commit messages.
6. [Issue a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)!
7. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-builder-k8s/actions) builds must succeed before the pull request can be reviewed and merged.
